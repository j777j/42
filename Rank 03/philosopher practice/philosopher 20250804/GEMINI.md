## Philosopher Project Analysis

### Initial State (August 4, 2025)

The project was in a state where it passed some tests but failed many others. The primary issues were:

*   **Deadlocks and Starvation:** In many "live" tests, philosophers would die because they were unable to acquire forks and eat. This pointed to a naive fork-picking algorithm and potential race conditions.
*   **Inaccurate Death Timers:** In some "die" tests, philosophers would live because the monitoring thread was not detecting their death correctly.

### August 4, 2025: Test Results and Analysis

**Test Command:**

```bash
./run_my_tests.sh
```

**Summary of Results:**

The test results show a mixed outcome. There are significant improvements in some areas, but also serious regressions in others.

*   **Improvements:** Many "live" tests that were previously failing are now passing. This indicates that the changes to the fork-picking logic and locking have reduced deadlocks and starvation.
*   **Regressions:** A significant number of "die" tests are now failing, with philosophers living when they should die. This is a major issue. Additionally, some "live" tests still fail, especially with high numbers of philosophers and tight timings.

**Analysis of Failures:**

The failures can be categorized as follows:

1.  **Philosopher dies when they shouldn't (Starvation):**
    *   `199 610 200 200 10`
    *   `131 605 200 200 10`
    *   `199 605 200 200 10`
    *   `130 401 200 200 10`
    *   `198 410 200 100 10`
    *   `198 401 200 200 10`

2.  **Philosopher lives when they should die (Incorrect Monitoring):**
    *   `31 599 200 200 10`
    *   `50 400 200 200 10`
    *   `3 600 200 200 10`
    *   `31 600 200 200 10`
    *   `131 596 200 200 10`
    *   `131 599 200 200 10`
    *   `131 600 200 200 10`
    *   `199 596 200 200 10`
    *   `199 599 200 200 10`
    *   `199 600 200 200 10`

**Conclusion:**

The current solution has improved the prevention of deadlocks but has introduced a new problem where the death timer is not being reliably checked. The locking mechanism is likely too aggressive, preventing the monitor thread from accurately detecting deaths. The next step is to refine the locking and timing to achieve a better balance between preventing starvation and ensuring accurate simulation.
